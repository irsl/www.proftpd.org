user on your system for the guest/anonymous ftp login. For security
reasons, it's very important that you make sure the user account
either has a password or has an "unmatchable" password. The root
directory of the guest/anonymous account doesn't have to be the user's
directory, but it makes sense to do so. After you have created the
account, put something like the following in your /etc/proftpd.conf

CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>The &lt;LOGIN&gt; directive is used to control connection or login
access to a particular context (the directive block which contains
it). When a client initially connects to ProFTPD, the daemon searches
the configuration tree for &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; directives, and
attached parameters (such as Allow, Deny, etc). If it determines that
there is no possible way for the client to ever be allowed to login,
such as a "Deny from" matching the client's source address, without an
overriding "Allow from" at a lower level, the client is disconnected
without being offered the opportunity to transmit a user and password.</P
><P
>However, if it is possible for the client to be allowed a login,
ProFTPD continues as per normal, allowing the client to login only if
the proper &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; applies. Normally, &lt;Limit&gt; directive blocks
are allowed in the server config, &lt;VirtualHost&gt;, &lt;Anonymous&gt;
and &lt;Directory&gt; contexts. However, &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; should not be
used in a &lt;Directory&gt; context, as clients do not connect/login to a
directory (and thus it is meaningless).</P
><P
>By way of example, the following configuration snippet illustrates a
&lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; deny which will cause any incoming connections from the
10.1.1.x subnet to be immediately disconnected, without a welcome
message:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>...
&lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;
Order deny,allow
Deny from 10.1.1.
Allow from all
&lt;/Limit&gt;
...
          </PRE
><P
>Next, an example of a configuration using &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; that will not
immediately disconnect an incoming client, but will return "Login
invalid" for all login attempts except anonymous.</P

>For general open access you can use an &lt;Anonymous&gt; directive context block,

><P
>However if you wish to jail an entire group (or groups) of users,
you can use the DefaultRoot directive.  DefaultRoot lets you specify a
root jailed directory (or "~" for the user's home directory), and an
optional group-expression argument which can be used to control which
groups of users the jail will be applied to. For example:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

&lt;VirtualHost myhost.mynet.foo&gt;
DefaultRoot ~
...
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

myhost.mynet.foo are jailed into their home directories (cannot chdir
into a higher level directory). Alternatively, you could:</P

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>...
&lt;VirtualHost myhost.mynet.foo&gt;
DefaultRoot /u2/public users,!staff
...
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
          </PRE
><P
>In this example, all users who are members of group "users", but
not members of group "staff" are jailed into /u2/public. If a user
does not meet the group-expression requirements, they login as per
normal (not jailed, default directory is their home).  You can use
multiple DefaultRoot directives to create multiple jails inside the
same directive context. If two DefaultRoot directives apply to the
same user, ProFTPD arbitrarily chooses one (based on how the
configuration file was parsed).</P

>Security Implications</H2
><P
>The DefaultRoot directive is implemented using the chroot(2) system
call.  This moves the "/" (or root) directory to a specified point
within the file system and jails the user into this sub-tree.  However
this is not the holy grail of security, a chroot jail can be broken,
it is not a trivial matter but it's nowhere near impossible.
DefaultRoot should be used as part of a general system of security not
the only security measure.</P

>There are two methods of accomplishing this (possibly more).
First, you can create a directory structure inside your anonymous FTP
root directory, creating a single directory for each user and setting
ownership/permissions as appropriate. Then, either create a symlink
from each user's home directory into the FTP site, or instruct your
users on how to access their directory.</P
><P
>The alternate method (and more versatile) of accomplishing per-user
anonymous FTP is to use AnonymousGroup in combination with the
DefaultRoot directory. You'll probably want to do this inside a
&lt;VirtualHost&gt;, otherwise none of your users will be able to access
your system without being stuck inside their per-user FTP site.
Additionally, you'll want to use a deferred &lt;Directory&gt; block to
carefully limit outside access to each user's site.</P

alias authentication only. Thus, if a client attempts to authenticate
as "jrluser", the anonymous config will be ignored and the client will
be authenticated as if they were a normal user (typically resulting in
`jrluser" logging in normally). However, if the client uses the
aliased username `ftp" or `anonymous", the anonymous block is applied.</P

CLASS="ANSWER"
><P

> </B
>To allow downloads to be resumed, you need to use the
   AllowRetrieveRestart configuration directive.</P
><P
>To allow uploads to be resumed, you need to use both the
   AllowOverwrite and AllowStoreRestart directives.  The reason that both
   need to be allowed is that a restarted/resumed upload is a form of
   overwriting the file.</P
><P
>Also note that using HiddenStores and AllowStoreRestart is incompatible,
   as mentioned in the documentation for the AllowStoreRestart
   and HiddenStores directives.</P
