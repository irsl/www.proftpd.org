consistantly.  Use <Limit SITE_CHMOD> instead.

- Bug 1112 - Compilation fix for IRIX 6.2.

  avoids DoS issues.  Built-in glob support is now always compiled in to
  proftpd regardless of libc support on build platform.

  in server ident, magic cookies and PASV commands.  Useful for firewalled or

- Bug 1042 - <Directory /> arbitrarily not matching.

1.2.1 - Released 03/01/2001
---------------------------------
- A relatively major issue was discovered with session.groups which may cause
  any group-expressions inside of <Limit> (DenyGroup, etc) to malfunction.
  This is the primary reason for the 1.2.1 release.
- Default CFLAGS changed from "-g3 -O6" to "-O2" because it is reported
  that -O6 is highly experimental, and including debugging really isn't all
  the useful, as someone _really_ interested in debugging can edit Make.rules.
- Defining classes without an explicit "Classes On" now generates a log
  warning.
- New mod_sql and mod_ldap from their respective maintainers.

1.2.0-final - Released 02/26/2001
---------------------------------
- Numerous additional bug fixes from Bugzilla.  See http://bugs.proftpd.org
  for more info.
- New and updated README.* and INSTALL.
- initgroups() support has been removed, it will be re-added in 1.3 after we
  have proper modular support in authentication modules.
- mod_sql.c, mod_sql_mysql.c and mod_sql_postgres.c back in, with a new
  maintainer (replacements for mod_sqlpw and friends).
- instead of using kill(pid,SIGCONT) to determine if scoreboard pids are
  correct, proftpd now uses kill(pid,0) which should be a lot lighter on
  heavy-load systems.  Thanks to Rob Schulhof <rrs@digisle.net> for pointing
  out that kill(pid,0) is both valid AND useful. ;) Also removed some
  completely useless and redundant /proc stat code which did the same thing
  as kill(pid,0) on linux systems.
- logging to file (via SystemLog) is now done with a single write instead of
  two in order to be atomic.

1.2.0rc3 - Released: 02/05/2001
-------------------------------
- mod_sqlpw.c, mod_mysql.c and mod_pgsql.c have been REMOVED from the
  distribution.  They are currently unmaintained and have numerous bugs.
  If any kind soul <grin> is interested in maintaining them, they may be
  brought back into a future version of proftpd.
- sendfile now defaults to off, use --enable-sendfile at configure
  time to enable.  Additionally, sendfile is probably fixed.
- initgroups/getgroups new defaults to off, use --enable-initgroups at
  configure time to enable (mainly useful for large systems).  Be careful,
  though, as initgroups/getgroups breaks module handling and will not work
  in conjunction with other third-party modules (mod_sqlpw, etc).
- Passive FTP works properly now (was broken in RC2).
- Compilation problems fixed on some obscure platforms.
- PAM authentication finally works again on Solaris (due to an annoying bug in
  Solaris).

  the error.

  CLF-style logs.

  symbolic links.

------------------------------
