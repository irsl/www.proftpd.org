1.2.9rc2 - Released 11-Sep-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 2051 - freebytes in TransferRate does not work properly.
- Bug 2043 - Proftpd converts LF to CRLF on PUT on Cygwin.  This turned out
  to be caused by the Cygwin layer.  The fix was to use the Cygwin-specific
  O_BINARY open() flag when opening binary files on Cygwin.
- Bug 1804 - Permit selection of additional contrib modules when building
  the RPM
- Bug 2074 - MaxStoreFileSize restriction capabilities ignored.  This bug
  was affecting MaxRetrieveFileSize as well.
- Bug 2075 - LIST / fails under Cygwin.  This was due to the addition of
  an additional path separator character; Cygwin treats paths that start
  with "//" differently than paths that start with "/".
- Bug 2076 - The --enable-transfer-buffer-size configure option doesn't work
  properly.  It was overriding the --enable-buffer-size option, rather than
  the corresponding tunable buffer size.
- Bug 2069 - Long MKD path causes truncated server response.
- Fixed handling of %N/%y in DisplayConnect files.
- Bug 2083 - "550 Access denied" on group permission with AuthGroupFile.  This
  was caused by a strictly linear search in the AuthGroupFile from the
  current file pointer to end of file, which (depending on the ordering of
  entries in the file) might have skipped necessary group entries.
- Bug 2088 - proftpd -t segfault.  A very specific configuration would cause
  a segfault in the configuration parser: if the first sub-context in a given
  context (e.g. a <Limit> context within a <Directory> context) was empty,
  the removal of that empty context from the internal structures by the
  parser would inadvertently trigger a segfault later.  This has been
  fixed by using a better memory pool, with a longer lifetime, for allocating
  the internal configuration structures.
- Bug 2090 - mod_rewrite doesn't compile on Solaris 8.  The FIONREAD macro
  was undefined, due to a strange necessity in the Solaris system headers
  for a missing flag.
- Bug 2100 - Invalid domain in <VirtualHost> tag causes segmentation fault.
- Fixed handling of mod_tls' TLSCertificateChainFile directive.
- Bug 2103 - AuthAliasOnly in server context causes hang.
- Bug 2110 - Segfault if gethostname(2) returns NULL.
- Bug 2113 - mod_sql default uses mysql keyword "password".  The default
  has been changed to "passwd".
- Bug 2115 - ftptop depends on snprintf but doesn't link in lib/libsupp.a
  on snprintf-less platforms
- Corrected handling of mod_tls' TLSCACertificateFile and TLSCACertificatePath
  directives so that they are properly allowed in <VirtualHost> and <Global>
  contexts.
- Bug 2119 - FEAT response format does not conform to RFC2389.  Extraneous
  leading whitespace removed.
- Fixed file descriptor leaks that occur if mod_tls encounters errors when
  handling CA certificate files.
- Bug 2118 - mod_sql's %F doesn't work for DELE command; %f is inconsistent.
  mod_sql's handling of cookies is now updated to match mod_log.
- Bug 1711 - IPv6 support.  Support for EPRT and EPSV added.  To enable IPv6
  support, use the new --enable-ipv6 configure option.
- Bug 2130 - %y in DisplayLogin is not updated correctly.
- Bug 2137 - NLST and IgnoreHidden causes segfault.
- Bug 2142 - sstrncpy() not available to lib/vsnprintf.c.  sstrncpy() is now
  implemented in the support library (libsupp.a).
- Bug 2144 - Rework autoconf handling of --enable-sia option.
- Bug 2147 - Segmentation fault processing file in ASCII mode.
- Fixed mod_ifsession's handling of multiple configuration sets.
- Bug 2148 - Enforce PR_TUNABLE_LOGIN_MAX.
- Bug 2141 - Glob Allow/Deny parameters cause extraneous log messages when
  comparing addresses.
- Bug 1804 - RPM spec file improvements
  The spec file now has xinetd support, builds under newer version of RPM,
  installs standalone support with the main proftpd RPM, and accepts --with
  mod_modname arguments during the build process.
- Bug 2127 - Entry in the file section
  The RPM spec's %files section now honors the install prefix.
- Bug 2108 - IgnoreHidden should not hide dotfiles
  Dotfiles are now displayed when the -a argument is supplied, even when the
  IgnoreHidden directive is enabled. To replicate the old behavior of hiding
  dotfiles no matter what, use either of the following directives:
    ListOptions "" strict
    HideFiles ^\..*
- Bug 2146 - DNS names not handled properly when --enable-ipv6 is used
  DNS names with both A and AAAA records were not being properly handled;
  listening sockets for both the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were not being
  established.
- Bug 2007 - autoconf header detection problem.
  On FreeBSD and other platforms, changes in autoconf require that headers
  be included in the proper order during configure's check.
- Bug 2153 - Small error in handling PR_AUTH_RFC2228 authentication code
- Bug 2154 - SQL query loses shell information.
  An index was not being properly incremented in some cases when retrieving
  user information.
- Bug 2161 - Duplicate autoconf check for sia.h.
- Bug 2122 - EAGAIN on Solaris can cause an infinite loop.
  Under certain conditions, when reading from a descriptor on Solaris,
  EAGAIN can be returned, which proftpd did not handle properly.

1.2.9rc1 - Released 15-May-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 1828 - mod_sql can only find mysql.sock if in /tmp.  This was caused
  by the fact that mod_sql_mysql did not load/read the MySQL .cnf
  configuration files.  Now, when starting, mod_sql_mysql will read .cnf
  files for "client" sections.
- Bug 1960 - Add removed file size by DELE command to xferlog.
- Bug 1967 - Add display of uptime to ftpwho, ftptop.
- Added AnonRejectPasswords directive.
- Added ftpshut -R command-line option, for deleting the ftpshut shutdown
  file.
- Bug 1972 - %T not correctly shows time at performance of a command "rename".
  This was due to improper use of uninitialized data.
- Bug 1794 - Scoreboard format changes.
- Bug 1979 - Add TLSTimeoutHandshake directive.  This adds a directive to
  configure a timer when SSL/TLS handshakes are occurring, to prevent
  a malicious client from attempting to DOS a TLS-enabled server.  The default
  timeout is 5 minutes.
- Bug 1869 - Add option "-S/--server" to ftpcount, ftptop, ftpwho.  This
  option can be used to specify a ServerName; the utilities will then
  display information for that specific server.
- Bug 1980 - Login with incorrect password possible when using mod_radius.
  This was caused by the retaining of the OK state when a user authenticated
  via RADIUS, but the login process later fails (e.g. home directory
  inaccessible or something similar); subsequent logging in as a different
  user would succeed because the OK flag was not cleared.
- Added contrib module mod_ifsession-0.9rc6.
- Bug 1932 - Make Max* checks a PASS POST_CMD handler.  One of the consequences
  of this change is that the Max* limits will always be enforced after the
  PASS command has been sent, not after the USER command (as used to be done).
  Also, MaxHostsPerUser and MaxClientsPerUser limits will be determined using
  the locally resolved username, not using any user aliases.
- ProFTPD now checks for IP address/port collisions in the configuration
  file, and will refuse to start unless all configured server contexts
  have unique IP address/port combinations.
- Bug 1969 - Add scoreboard-scrubbing timer.  The scoreboard will be scanned
  now every 30 seconds for entries with invalid PIDs; this timer can be
  adjusted using the PR_TUNABLE_SCOREBOARD_SCRUB_TIMER #define.
- Bug 1921 - Socket-level performance tweaks.  This change deprecates the
  tcpReceiveWindow and tcpSendWindow configuration directives, replacing
  them with a single SocketOptions configuration directive.  This new
  directive can be used to tune the TCP send and receive window sizes as well
  as the TCP max segment size.  A new configure option,
  --enable-transfer-buffer-size, is also added, to be used for tuning the
  size of internal buffers used for file transfers.  Using this option to
  configure an 8K buffer size often results in higher transfer speeds.
- Bug 1849 - Compile can have trouble finding mysql.h.  The MySQL backend
  module was assuming that mysql.h would be found in a directory named
  "mysql"; for some distributions this is not the case.  Similarly for
  the Postgres backend module and the libpq-fe.h file.  Users may need to
  alter the --with-includes configure option used when building mod_sql.
- Bug 1915 - Unsafe pointer usage in scoreboard file format.
- Bug 1983 - Filenames beginning with '#' fail to upload/download.
- Bug 1985 - mod_rewrite fails to build on platforms without flock().
- Bug 1730 - mod_sql_mysql logging of long transfers fails.  This turned out
  to be caused by the default MySQL timeouts on non-interactive sessions
  (8 hours).  The fix involves marking mod_sql_mysql sessions as interactive;
  this means that users may use the 'interactive-timeout' option in their
  .cnf files to override the default interactive session timeout (also 8 hours).
- Bug 1989 - SQLLog '*' doesn't match any commands.
- Bug 1986 - mod_rewrite backreferences not zero-based (use $1 not $0?). The
  bug here turned out to be an off-by-one offset; mod_rewrite was starting
  at 1 when examining matched groups, rather than 0.  Most of the time $0 will
  not what is desired, however, for $0 refers to the original string being
  matched.
- Bug 1987 - mod_rewrite seems not to handle more than one backreference.
- By default, mod_tls will now turn manually turn RSA blinding on, when
  OpenSSL older than 0.9.7b is used, in order to thwart certain timing attacks
  possible against RSA operations. The following URL contains more information:
  http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030317.txt
- Bug 1995 - incorrect handling of curses/ncurses header and libraries in
  ftptop
- New mod_radius directives: RadiusGroupInfo, RadiusVendor.  mod_radius
  now looks for custom response information in Vendor-Specific Attributes
  (VSAs) rather than the normal RADIUS attributes; VSAs are more flexible.
- Fixed a bug with mod_tls' use of SSL_shutdown(), to prevent it from hanging
  when interacting with some buggy FTPS clients (e.g FlashFXP, SmartFTP)
- Bug 1935 - mod_ls memory leak.  When a recursive directory listing is
  requested (and allowed), proftpd would use its memory pool system,
  allocating memory for every file to be listed.  For large/deep directory
  structures, this memory usage could grow quite large.  And, due to the
  way in which the underlying memory allocator (the C library, usually)
  works, that memory is never really released back to the operating system.
  This means that tools like ps and top reporting a never-shrinking memory
  footprint for the process.  To help alleviate this, proftpd has been
  altered to use malloc/realloc when providing recursive directory listings,
  making the memory footprint a little smaller.  The caching behavior of
  the underlying memory allocator cannot be changed, though.
- Bug 1997 - UnixWare 7.1.3 & port 20.
- Bug 1998 - Add ListOptions for setting limits on -R listings.  New
  keywords have been added to the ListOptions directive: maxdepth, maxdirs,
  and maxfiles.
- Bug 2011 - No "FTP session closed." msgs written to logfile.  This affected
  only inetd-run servers.
- Added two new configure options, --disable-curses and --disable-ncurses.
  By default, ftptop will use ncurses if available, then curses (if available).
  In some cases, both curses and ncurses may be present, and yet the admin
  would prefer ftptop to use curses.  Using the above options, one can
  disable ftptop's use of ncurses or curses, as needed.
- Bug 2016 - man pages should be autogenerated to reflect the --prefix used.
- Bug 2018 - Incorrect caching of TransferRate values.
- Bug 1813 - configure code: mistake in BSD sendfile semantic detection.
- Bug 2019 - proftpd support for Solaris 8/9 native sendfile
- Bug 2002 - Per-<Directory> PathAllowFilter/PathDenyFilter.
- Added RootRevoke directive.
- Bug 2021 - Inetd mode and scoreboard format changes.
- Bug 1532 - Human readable disk free cookie.  Display* files can now make
  use of a %f magic cookie for displaying the available disk space with
  units (i.e. KB, MB, GB, etc).  This compliments the currently available
  %F cookie, used to display the number of bytes of available space (without
  units).
- Bug 2003 - mod_auth.c does not compile for cygwin on W2K.
- Bug 2029 - Rewrite rule may execute more than once if multiple
  RewriteConditions exist.  This turned out to be caused by mod_rewrite's
  merging down of its directives, and the way in which multiple occurrences
  of directives are handled.  Now, even for merged-down mod_rewrite directives,
  a given RewriteRule will only be processed once.
- Fixed minor fd leak where listening socket descriptors were not being
  properly closed in a session process, when the session is first starting.
- Cygwin compilation/portability fixes.
- Fixed bug where AllowForeignAddress was not properly blocking "bounce"
  attacks in some cases.  Patch contributed by Patrick Hardy <kaber@trash.net>.
- Bug 2032 - AuthOrder not working when first option is mod_auth_file.c.  This
  was caused by mod_auth_file's returning of an ERROR condition, rather than
  DECLINED, when the module could not obtain the user's encrypted password
  for verification.
- Bug 2047 - 1024 or more chars in .ftpaccess causes lockup.  Certain conditions
  allowed for parsing of configuration files to enter an infinite loop.
- Bug 2031 - Add support for flags for RewriteCondition, RewriteRule
  (a la Apache's mod_rewrite).  mod_rewrite now supports various tests that
  can be used in RewriteConditions, the NC and OR flags for RewriteConditions,
  and the NC and L flags for RewriteRules.
- Bug 1977 - Add %u variable support in configuration file.  With this feature,
  one can configure DefaultRoot paths such as /home/%u/public_ftp, and the
  %u variable will be expanded to the logged in user name.

1.2.8 - Released 04-Mar-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 1863 - Unable to build under UnixWare 7
- Bug 1943 - Unable to install on FreeBSD 5.0.  FreeBSD 5.0's header files
  have been rewritten, and glibc's glob.h collided with the new files.  The
  fix was simply to use size_t, rather than trying to determine and use
  __size_t (glob.h was intended to be used during library compilation, not
  during application compilation).
- Bug 1950 - OSX setgrent(3) returns int, causing compiler warning.  Unlike
  most other Unix flavours (but like FreeBSD), OSX's setgrent(3) returns
  int, rather than void.  A configure check was written to test for this. 
- Bug 1949 - Compiler warns of 'long double' usage on OSX.  Typecasts have
  been added to quell some warnings, and an autoconf check added for compiler
  support for -Wno-long-double to quell others.
- Bug 1952 - Umask Bug: Server Not Honoring VirtualHost Umask.  This was
  a statcache caching effect bug.
- Bug 1916 - Transfers hang with strange transfertime in logfile.  This
  appears to have been due to use of an uninitialized value.
- Bug 1948 - mod_xfer relinquishes privs before chmod takes place.  In
  places where UserOwner is used to "give away" files, the chmod() attempt
  that follows the chown() (used to preserve permissions sometimes altered
  by the operating system's chown(2) call) did not use root privs, and thus
  the client did not have permission to write the file.
- Added FTPS FEAT responses, as per Section 5 of the FTPS Draft.
- Bug 1956 - Upload transfer rate broken.  The wrong variable was being used.
- Bug 1941 - SCO OpenServer 5.0.5 issues.  Fixing this bug required adding
  more autoconf portability checks.
- Bug 1958 - ftpwho -o oneline has newlines when client is idle.
- Bug 1908 - ExtendedLog to work properly again in <Anonymous> context.
- Bug 1966 - SCO OpenServer 5.0.5 and inetd.
- Bug 1953 - STAT -R does not work.  There were some variable initialization
  issues in the handling of options for the STAT command.
- Bug 1970 - Transfer time wraps around and causes problems with transfer
  speed calculation.  This was a reporting problem, mostly.  An internal
  variable was storing time in microseconds; now using milliseconds.
- Bug 1937 - Transfer hangs when using TransferRate limits on a resumed
  download.  This turned out to be a misuse of the resumed file position
  when calculating the TransferRate.
- Bug 1964 - When uploading to an NFS mounted file system in passive mode
  read() get EAGAIN and closes connection.  This turned out to be caused
  by control messages in the STREAMS device (and thus relevant only to
  systems that use STREAMS).
- Portability fixes for FreeBSD-5.0.
- Bug 1976 - Login hangs, spawned process runs in endless loop in mod_auth.
  This was caused by a combination of "AuthAliasOnly on" and UserAlias
  directives in which the alias and the username were identical.  Different
  alias and username in a UserAlias directive is now required.

1.2.8rc2 - Released 29-Jan-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 1894 - Double chdir into self-referencing symlink fails with
  "No such file or directory".  The errno value has been changed from
   ENOENT to ELOOP.
- Bug 1272 - Requested Addition: DenyFilter by User or DenyFilter by Directory.
  AllowFilter and DenyFilter are now extended to <Directory> and .ftpaccess
  contexts.
- Bug 1671 - new directive SQLLogFile.
- mod_linuxprivs has been renamed to mod_cap and is now built into ProFTPD
  by default if the host OS (Linux) supports it. autoconf detection code
  based on a submission by Mihai RUSU <dizzy@roedu.net>.  The mod_cap
  directives are CapabilitiesEngine and CapabilitiesSet.
- Bug 1893 - Apple likes to move things. PAM support works on OS X again.
  Submitted by: thesin@users.sourceforge.net (Justin F. Hallett)
- Bug 1826 - Makefiles are a bit icky
- Bug 1904 - Tru64 UNIX 4.0D and sstrncpy()
- Bug 1891 - SGI syslog isn't being written to.  Turns out that /dev/log on
  SGI is a STREAMS device, just as for Solaris.  The fix for this bug works
  for IRIX6; earlier versions of IRIX may still see this bug.
- Bug 1919 - <Directory> section already configured for $dir needs
  clarification.  This has been resolved by adding a debug statement (level 2)
  to the <Directory> handler that reports on the given/resolved paths used.
- Bug 1910 - ProFTPD hangs on SIGHUP.  This was triggered by mixing stdio
  and regular I/O library calls related to password and group entries.
- Add -Wundef and -Wfloat-equal to CFLAGS (Suggested by Steve Grubb
  <linux_4ever@yahoo.com>)
- Fixed broken tcpReceiveWindow and tcpSendWindow configuration directives.
  The setsockopt(2) function was being called at the wrong time during the
  establishment of the data connection.
- %f for DELE commands was not being properly expanded.
- Bug 1923 - %N magic cookie reports incorrectly.  This was an off-by-one
  bug.
- %L was reporting the remote IP address, rather than the local IP address.
- Bug 1922 - Server allows RNTO an existing file even with AllowOverwrite
  turned off.  Now, RNTOs to existing files are denied unless AllowOverwrite
  is on.
- ftptop now displays transfer rates in it's "transfer speed" display mode.
  Use the 't' key to toggle between ftptop display modes.
- Bug 1926 - AuthOrder doesn't work
- Bug 1918 - AuthUserFile not works normally.
- Bug 1241 - Additional functionality: HomedirOnDemand.  This has been added
  as a new configuration directive, CreateHome.
- Bug 1734 - Cygwin - Unable to set uid
- Bug 1938 - upload to root directory fails.  This was caused by caching
  effects.
- Bug 1939 - RLimitMemory seems broken.  The problem turned out to be bad
  handling of the case where sizes were used without specifying units.
- Bug 1911 - NLST is not being Limited in DIRS.  The issue was that directory
  paths were not being properly expanded, for purposes of looking up <Limit>s,
  in the handling of NLST.

1.2.8rc1 - Released 28-Dec-2002
---------------------------------
- Bug 1597 - Problems with HP-UX 10/11 trusted systems, mod_pam, and mod_unixpw.
- Bug 1482 - Add new %U meta to LogFormat, for logging original username.
- Bug 1683 - Handling of VirtualHosts on startup.  Now, rather than dying
  when unable to resolve a <VirtualHost> DNS hostname when starting up, the
  daemon will log the error, and skip the bad <VirtualHost>.
- Bug 1825 - AUTH macro namespace cleanup.  A "PR_" prefix has been added to
  the AUTH_* macros, to help prevent namespace collisions.  This means that
  some third-party auth modules may need to be updated.
- Bug 1806 - Add RFC2389 support.
- Bug 1833 - Add ability to have add'l module initialization callback.
- Bug 1743 - No magic cookie for number of files transfered.  New cookies
  added for Display* files: "%i" for total number of files uploaded (read "in")
  during a session, "%o" for total number of files download (written "out")
  during a session, and "%t" for total number of files transferred (both
  uploaded and downloaded).
- Bug 1653 - Complete the FS API abstraction implementation.  The Developer
  Guide will have the complete details on using this API.
- Bug 1712 - TLS support.  mod_tls-2.0.5 has been added to the distribution.
  Many, many thanks to Peter Runestig for his work on this, and for maintaining
  his code through so many versions of ProFTPD.
- Bug 1788 - Add ability to configure auth module checking order.  This is
  now configurable via the new AuthOrder directive.
- Bug 1205 - Add debug option to SystemLog.  Actually, this feature request
  has been resolved by adding a new DebugLevel configuration directive, so
  that a debugging verbosity can be set in the configuration file as well
  as on the command line.
- Added mod_rewrite to distribution.
- Bug 1403 - per-server system logs via ServerLog directive.
- Bug 1605 - MKD and RMD do not log filepaths with %f or %F option in
  ExtendedLog.
- Removing the RateRead* and RateWrite* configuration directives, and replacing
  them with a single new directive, TransferRate.
- Bug 1789 - Add ability to block recursive directory listings.  The
  LsDefaultOptions configuration directive has been deprecated in favor of
  the more feature-rich ListOptions directive.
- Added Bindings API
- Bug 1515 - Enable mod_log to log into default log / syslog.  The ExtendedLog
  directive can now take a "path" of the form: "syslog:level", where the
  "syslog:" prefix tells mod_log to log that ExtendedLog data via syslog,
  and the "level" informs mod_log of which syslog level to use.
- AIX sendfile support. Thanks to Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru> for the patch.
- 1858 - move "session closed" logging from graceful quit to child exit
  sequence.  This allows for better log reporting, with respect to sessions
  ended through means such as catastrophic death of client, or segfaults.
- Added --enable-devel configure option, for enabling code of interest to
  developers
- Bug 1507 - regex pattern matching in [Allow/Deny][User/Group].  This has
  been implemented by adding a "regex" optional parameter to the AllowGroup,
  DenyGroup, AllowUser, and DenyUser directives.  The documentation will
  be adjusted accordingly.
- Bug 1882 - SITE chmod 777 file<space>name.  The patch for this works
  for filename parameters to the SITE CHGRP command as well.
- Bug 1881 - Bug in Function MaxClients.  This was caused by an off-by-one
  bug in the handling of non-anonymous settings.
- Bug 1886 - Ftpwho uses too many lines when authenticating.
- Bug 1875 - same radius packet id for start- and stop-accounting record.
- Bug 1883 - socklen_t patch. Thanks to Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru> for the
  patch.
- Bug 1885 - -q/--quiet option for use with the -n/--nodaemon flag. Useful
  for running proftpd from inittab or with daemontools.
- Bug 1677 - Integrate ProFTPD with C2/SIA on Tru64 Unix.  The --enable-sia
  configure option has been added.
- Bug 1837 - Add module specifically for handling Auth*Files, providing
  finer-grained control.  The new mod_auth_file module is compiled in by
  default, and can be disabled using the --disable-auth-file configure option.
  For consistency, mod_unixpw.c has been renamed to mod_auth_unix (and now
  has a --disable-auth-unix configure option), and mod_pam.c has been renamed
  to mod_auth_pam.c (with an explicit --enable-auth-pam configure option).
- Bug 1900 - ftpwho's output on uploads.  ftpwho now reports "n/a" rather than
  "0%" on uploads, for the server does not know how large of a file is being
  uploaded in advance, and cannot determine a "percentage done" value.
- Bug 1888 - Increase mod_linuxprivs configurability.  Two new directives,
  LinuxPrivsEngine and LinuxPrivsCapabilities, are added.
- Bug 1905 - AIX needs "config.h" included before *anything* else.
- Bug 1903 - ftpwho depends on snprintf but doesn't link in lib/libsupp.a
  Primarily of issue under Solaris 2.5 and Tru64 4.0D.
- Bug 1863 - Unable to build under UnixWare 7
- Bug 1906 - Add description strings to AC_DEFINE

1.2.7 - Released 05-Dec-2002
----------------------------
- Bug 1840 - Problem with syslog default destination on HP-UX.  HPUX uses
  a default device of /dev/log.un rather than /dev/log.
- Bug 1844 - DisplayLogin %y macro is off by 1.  Consequence of scoreboarding
  code changes.
- Bug 1838 - Since 1.2.6: in add_useralias() setting flag CF_MERGEDOWN breaks
  aliased anonymous functionality.  The fix was to set the CF_MERGEDOWN flag
  only if the UserAlias directive is not being used in the <Anonymous>
  context.
- Bug 1812 - Double logging lines for ExtendedLog.  No need to merge this
  particular directive down.
- Bug 1848 - undefined reference to `halfdelay'. curses does not seem to
  provide this function, as ncurses does.  The patch works around this by
  using halfdelay() if linking against ncurses, and using nodelay() and sleep()
  if linking against curses.
- Bug 1839 - undefined reference to `get_fs_size'. Expand BSD
  statfs()/statvfs() support beyond FreeBSD.
- Bug 1680 - Error in startup script. Add /usr/local/sbin/ to the included
  rc script's $PATH
- Bug 1852 - Proftpd gets signal 11 on "quote site".  The mod_site module
  was not properly checking the number of parameters for SITE commands.
- Bug 1856 - TimesGMT acts like default is 'off'.  The default for this
  directive was inadvertently set to "off", rather than the documented default
  setting of "on".
- Bug 1853 - SyslogFacility: unable to open syslog.  This turned out to be
  due to the fact that /dev/log on Solaris (and other platforms?) is a
  STREAMS device, which requires open() and putmsg(), rather than connect()
  and send().
- 1846 - File overwrites fail.  Tracked down by Sergei Rozinov to involve
  uninitialized stack data.
- Bug 1861 - 'ftpwho -v -o oneline' print all connections in one line.  This
  bug appeared in 1.2.7rc3, a consequnce of Bug#1815.
- Bug 1868 - Wrong cmdopts in ftpcount.c.
- Added custom memory scrubber routine to deal with the issue mentioned in
  this Bugtraq thread: http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/298598

1.2.7rc3 - Released 15-Nov-2002
-------------------------------
- Fixed configure script detection and handling of ncurses (HAVE_LIBNCURSES
  was not being properly defined).
- Added --enable-scoreboard-buffer-size option to configure script, for
  tuning the size of some scoreboard fields (e.g. the full client command
  and the current working directory).
- Bug 1287 - Error compile with autoshadow option.  AIX does not have
  traditional shadow support, and uses other mechanisms.  This means that
  the --enable-autoshadow and --enable-shadow configure options should not
  be used when configuring proftpd for AIX.  The configure script has been
  updated to detect when these options are used on AIX, and to automatically
  disable them.
- Bug 1722 - Can't work magic cookie %F on FreeBSD.
- Make sure session.xfer uses cleared memory so unset structure members
  won't contain random values.
- Fixed handling of AuthAliasOnly, broken slightly by Bug#1567.
- Bug 1800 - Proftpd child segfaults when using a PASS without no USER first.
  mod_wrap was making a bad assumption about the USER name being available.
  This assumption has been corrected.
- Bug 1803 - Check for SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG to determine LFS support
  breaks some Linux installations
- Bug 1805 - PAM support under Mac OS X
- Bug 1772 - Docs fixup in RPM spec file
- Bug 1398 - there is no log rotate for /var/log/xferlog
- Bug 1814 - class names are truncated in scoreboard entry
- ftptop can now use either curses or ncurses
- Bug 1818 - proftpd doesn't compile on hpux11
- Bug 1760 - AllowOverwrite not operational.
- Bug 1703 - mod_sql_mysql compile error.  This was eventually tracked down
  to an overlap between ProFTPD's bundled getopt implementation, and
  MySQL's bundled getopt implementation.  To prevent this problem, a new
  --without-getopt configure option has been added, which tells the ProFTPD
  build process to explicitly not use the ProFTPD bundled getopt
  implementation.
- Only link ftptop with lib{n,}curses - it isn't needed in any other
  binaries
- Bug 1815 - Patch to add class information to ftpwho (with verbose on)
- Bug 1810 - Wrong permissions assigned to uploaded file.  This turned out
  to be related to the addition of the statcache code, and its interaction
  with the UserOwner and GroupOwner configuration directives.
- Bug 1830 - MaxClientsPerHost (small) Bug.  Off-by-one error in the handling
  of the MaxClientsPerHost directive, introduced by the change in timing of
  scoreboard modifications of the new scoreboarding code.
- ftpasswd now exits with different values, depending on the problem cause.
  Thanks to Graham Dunn <gdunn@inscriber.com> for these changes.

1.2.7rc2 - Released 22-Oct-2002
-------------------------------
- Bug 1757 - non-ANSI Syntax in netio.c
- Bug 1735 - Proftpd 1.2.6 compiled on FreeBSD 4.6.2 exits on signal 11
- Bug 1759 - ftpwho shows much more connections than really is.  This bug
             only occurred for those daemons running in inetd mode.
- Bug 1769 - Lack of supplemental groups can cause segfault.  This bug is
             a result of the fix for Bug 1666.
- Bug 1770 - Forgetting to check for no IP in string.
- Moved the switching to the User/Group for a vhost up in the order, to occur
  before any modules' session initialization callback is invoked.
- Bug 1644 - LogFormat local IP and FQDN tags missing.  Added %L to LogFormat
             meta sequences for logging local server IP address, and %V for
             logging local server FQDN.
- Bug 1785 - Bad handling of symlinks.  This bug appeared as a consequence
             of Bug#1486's fix, which involved caching of struct stats in
             order to effect a speed-up of directory listings.
- Bug 1778 - 1.2.7rc1 fails to link on OpenBSD 3.2-current.  The ftptop
             utility was not properly utilizing the macro detecting the
             presence (or absence) of the ncurses library.
- Adding new configure options (see configure --help) for setting some of
  the "tunable" values in options.h via the configure command.

- Bug 1701 - Fixed/enhanced name/IP matching function by adding matching of

1.2.6rc1 - Released 02-July-2002
--------------------------------
- Bug 1407 - Removed unnecessary check for prior PORT/PASV in STOR
             PRE_CMD handler (RETR PRE_CMD handler did not have these checks)
- Added new Define, <IfDefine>, <IfModule> configuration directives, new
  command-line option -D (a la Apache)

- Bug 1569 - Cygwin support, added README.cygwin
- Bug 1171 - Added handling backslash-escaped newlines in configuration files,

             a trailing \ before the newline character.
- Removed the deprecated AllowChmod and ShowDotFiles configuration directives.
- Bug 1655 - Added support for a -n option when listing directories.
- Bug 1502 - Added a lingering_close function.  As discussed in the bug
             report, this may cause issues with some clients; keep an eye
             for this, as the timeout (ten minutes) may be too long or short.
- Bug 1664 - Changed mod_sql to decline UID-to-name resolution if a UID
             field has been configured to NULL; similarly for GID.
- Removed mod_quota.c due to bugs, lack of maintainership.  Consult
  http://bugs.proftpd.org for a list of the mod_quota bugs.
- Bug 1667 - Moved definition of USE_SHADOW, AUTO_SHADOW macros from command
             line into config.h, with the other macros.
- Bug 1628 - Added getgroups auth handler to mod_sql.  The lack of this was
             causing some DefaultRoot directives (those that relied on
             group-expressions) not be correctly honored, as mod_sql was
             not supplying the groups for the users.
- Bug 1543 - Change mod_sql to not remove embedded whitespace within a
             username, just to strip leading and trailing whitespace.

             docs
- Bug 1601 - RNTO handler did not properly cleanup after itself in an
             error condition, tickling a later segfault

consistantly.  Use <Limit SITE_CHMOD> instead.

- Bug 1112 - Compilation fix for IRIX 6.2.
- Bug 1128 - Fixed possibled Linux sendfile() corruption issue.

  <Global> to vhosts.
- Bug 1049 - New User/Groups weren't being seen after startup w/out a SIGHUP.
- Bug 1066 - new GNU glob() and friends, which properly limits recursion and
  avoids DoS issues.  Built-in glob support is now always compiled in to
  proftpd regardless of libc support on build platform.
- New directive "MasqueradeAddress", used to emit a "fake" (non-interface) IP
  in server ident, magic cookies and PASV commands.  Useful for firewalled or
  NAT'd networks that are not FTP aware.
- Bug 1044 - New directive "AccessDenyMsg", works just like AccessAllowMsg,
  but does the obvious.
- Bug 1055 - Not really a bug, but still .. ftpwho/ftpcount now attempt to
  scan proftpd.conf looking for ScoreboardPath, if all else fails
- Bug 1042 - <Directory /> arbitrarily not matching.

1.2.1 - Released 01-Mar-2001
----------------------------
- A relatively major issue was discovered with session.groups which may cause
  any group-expressions inside of <Limit> (DenyGroup, etc) to malfunction.
  This is the primary reason for the 1.2.1 release.
- Default CFLAGS changed from "-g3 -O6" to "-O2" because it is reported
  that -O6 is highly experimental, and including debugging really isn't all
  the useful, as someone _really_ interested in debugging can edit Make.rules.
- Defining classes without an explicit "Classes On" now generates a log
  warning.
- New mod_sql and mod_ldap from their respective maintainers.

1.2.0-final - Released 26-Feb-2001
----------------------------------
- Numerous additional bug fixes from Bugzilla.  See http://bugs.proftpd.org
  for more info.
- New and updated README.* and INSTALL.
- initgroups() support has been removed, it will be re-added in 1.3 after we
  have proper modular support in authentication modules.
- mod_sql.c, mod_sql_mysql.c and mod_sql_postgres.c back in, with a new
  maintainer (replacements for mod_sqlpw and friends).
- instead of using kill(pid,SIGCONT) to determine if scoreboard pids are
  correct, proftpd now uses kill(pid,0) which should be a lot lighter on
  heavy-load systems.  Thanks to Rob Schulhof <rrs@digisle.net> for pointing
  out that kill(pid,0) is both valid AND useful. ;) Also removed some
  completely useless and redundant /proc stat code which did the same thing
  as kill(pid,0) on linux systems.
- logging to file (via SystemLog) is now done with a single write instead of
  two in order to be atomic.

1.2.0rc3 - Released: 05-Feb-2001
--------------------------------
- mod_sqlpw.c, mod_mysql.c and mod_pgsql.c have been REMOVED from the
  distribution.  They are currently unmaintained and have numerous bugs.
  If any kind soul <grin> is interested in maintaining them, they may be
  brought back into a future version of proftpd.
- sendfile now defaults to off, use --enable-sendfile at configure
  time to enable.  Additionally, sendfile is probably fixed.
- initgroups/getgroups new defaults to off, use --enable-initgroups at
  configure time to enable (mainly useful for large systems).  Be careful,
  though, as initgroups/getgroups breaks module handling and will not work
  in conjunction with other third-party modules (mod_sqlpw, etc).
- Passive FTP works properly now (was broken in RC2).
- Compilation problems fixed on some obscure platforms.
- PAM authentication finally works again on Solaris (due to an annoying bug in
  Solaris).
- Added the DeleteAbortedStores directive.
- Fixed a minor bug in SITE HELP.
- Eliminated a race when logging in with MaxClients.
- AllowChmod defaults to 'on' now for simplicity and compatibility.
- Honor ExtendedLog NONE.
- Added SyslogLevel directive.
- Added --with-includes option to configure.
- Added --with-libraries option to configure.
- On systems with wtmpx, don't use wtmp at all.
- Handle files that begin with ~ properly.
- Documentation updated for PAM on FreeBSD operating systems.
- NUMEROUS other bug fixes, including many security issues

1.2.0RC2 - Released: 27-Jul-2000
--------------------------------
- Made sure ServerUseReverseDNS was honored.
- Compile problems on various problems.
- Added descriptions for more errors to be more RFC compliant.
- UID/GID handling is more portable now on systems with unusual UID/GID sizes.
- PAM handles should be persistent across jailed environments.

  the error.
