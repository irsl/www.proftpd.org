1.2.8rc1 - Released 28-Dec-2002
---------------------------------
- Bug 1597 - Problems with HP-UX 10/11 trusted systems, mod_pam, and mod_unixpw.
- Bug 1482 - Add new %U meta to LogFormat, for logging original username.
- Bug 1683 - Handling of VirtualHosts on startup.  Now, rather than dying
  when unable to resolve a <VirtualHost> DNS hostname when starting up, the
  daemon will log the error, and skip the bad <VirtualHost>.
- Bug 1825 - AUTH macro namespace cleanup.  A "PR_" prefix has been added to
  the AUTH_* macros, to help prevent namespace collisions.  This means that
  some third-party auth modules may need to be updated.
- Bug 1806 - Add RFC2389 support.
- Bug 1833 - Add ability to have add'l module initialization callback.
- Bug 1743 - No magic cookie for number of files transfered.  New cookies
  added for Display* files: "%i" for total number of files uploaded (read "in")
  during a session, "%o" for total number of files download (written "out")
  during a session, and "%t" for total number of files transferred (both
  uploaded and downloaded).
- Bug 1653 - Complete the FS API abstraction implementation.  The Developer
  Guide will have the complete details on using this API.
- Bug 1712 - TLS support.  mod_tls-2.0.5 has been added to the distribution.
  Many, many thanks to Peter Runestig for his work on this, and for maintaining
  his code through so many versions of ProFTPD.
- Bug 1788 - Add ability to configure auth module checking order.  This is
  now configurable via the new AuthOrder directive.
- Bug 1205 - Add debug option to SystemLog.  Actually, this feature request
  has been resolved by adding a new DebugLevel configuration directive, so
  that a debugging verbosity can be set in the configuration file as well
  as on the command line.
- Added mod_rewrite to distribution.
- Bug 1403 - per-server system logs via ServerLog directive.
- Bug 1605 - MKD and RMD do not log filepaths with %f or %F option in
  ExtendedLog.
- Removing the RateRead* and RateWrite* configuration directives, and replacing
  them with a single new directive, TransferRate.
- Bug 1789 - Add ability to block recursive directory listings.  The
  LsDefaultOptions configuration directive has been deprecated in favor of
  the more feature-rich ListOptions directive.
- Added Bindings API
- Bug 1515 - Enable mod_log to log into default log / syslog.  The ExtendedLog
  directive can now take a "path" of the form: "syslog:level", where the
  "syslog:" prefix tells mod_log to log that ExtendedLog data via syslog,
  and the "level" informs mod_log of which syslog level to use.
- AIX sendfile support. Thanks to Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru> for the patch.
- 1858 - move "session closed" logging from graceful quit to child exit
  sequence.  This allows for better log reporting, with respect to sessions
  ended through means such as catastrophic death of client, or segfaults.
- Added --enable-devel configure option, for enabling code of interest to
  developers
- Bug 1507 - regex pattern matching in [Allow/Deny][User/Group].  This has
  been implemented by adding a "regex" optional parameter to the AllowGroup,
  DenyGroup, AllowUser, and DenyUser directives.  The documentation will
  be adjusted accordingly.
- Bug 1882 - SITE chmod 777 file<space>name.  The patch for this works
  for filename parameters to the SITE CHGRP command as well.
- Bug 1881 - Bug in Function MaxClients.  This was caused by an off-by-one
  bug in the handling of non-anonymous settings.
- Bug 1886 - Ftpwho uses too many lines when authenticating.
- Bug 1875 - same radius packet id for start- and stop-accounting record.
- Bug 1883 - socklen_t patch. Thanks to Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru> for the
  patch.
- Bug 1885 - -q/--quiet option for use with the -n/--nodaemon flag. Useful
  for running proftpd from inittab or with daemontools.
- Bug 1667 - Integrate ProFTPD with C2/SIA on Tru64 Unix.  The --enable-sia
  configure option has been added.
- Bug 1837 - Add module specifically for handling Auth*Files, providing
  finer-grained control.  The new mod_auth_file module is compiled in by
  default, and can be disabled using the --disable-auth-file configure option.
  For consistency, mod_unixpw.c has been renamed to mod_auth_unix (and now
  has a --disable-auth-unix configure option), and mod_pam.c has been renamed
  to mod_auth_pam.c (with an explicit --enable-auth-pam configure option).
- Bug 1900 - ftpwho's output on uploads.  ftpwho now reports "n/a" rather than
  "0%" on uploads, for the server does not know how large of a file is being
  uploaded in advance, and cannot determine a "percentage done" value.
- Bug 1888 - Increase mod_linuxprivs configurability.  Two new directives,
  LinuxPrivsEngine and LinuxPrivsCapabilities, are added.
- Bug 1905 - AIX needs "config.h" included before *anything* else.
- Bug 1903 - ftpwho depends on snprintf but doesn't link in lib/libsupp.a
  Primarily of issue under Solaris 2.5 and Tru64 4.0D.
- Bug 1863 - Unable to build under UnixWare 7
- Bug 1906 - Add description strings to AC_DEFINE

1.2.7 - Released 05-Dec-2002
----------------------------
- Bug 1840 - Problem with syslog default destination on HP-UX.  HPUX uses
  a default device of /dev/log.un rather than /dev/log.
- Bug 1844 - DisplayLogin %y macro is off by 1.  Consequence of scoreboarding
  code changes.
- Bug 1838 - Since 1.2.6: in add_useralias() setting flag CF_MERGEDOWN breaks
  aliased anonymous functionality.  The fix was to set the CF_MERGEDOWN flag
  only if the UserAlias directive is not being used in the <Anonymous>
  context.
- Bug 1812 - Double logging lines for ExtendedLog.  No need to merge this
  particular directive down.
- Bug 1848 - undefined reference to `halfdelay'. curses does not seem to
  provide this function, as ncurses does.  The patch works around this by
  using halfdelay() if linking against ncurses, and using nodelay() and sleep()
  if linking against curses.
- Bug 1839 - undefined reference to `get_fs_size'. Expand BSD
  statfs()/statvfs() support beyond FreeBSD.
- Bug 1680 - Error in startup script. Add /usr/local/sbin/ to the included
  rc script's $PATH
- Bug 1852 - Proftpd gets signal 11 on "quote site".  The mod_site module
  was not properly checking the number of parameters for SITE commands.
- Bug 1856 - TimesGMT acts like default is 'off'.  The default for this
  directive was inadvertently set to "off", rather than the documented default
  setting of "on".
- Bug 1853 - SyslogFacility: unable to open syslog.  This turned out to be
  due to the fact that /dev/log on Solaris (and other platforms?) is a
  STREAMS device, which requires open() and putmsg(), rather than connect()
  and send().
- 1846 - File overwrites fail.  Tracked down by Sergei Rozinov to involve
  uninitialized stack data.
- Bug 1861 - 'ftpwho -v -o oneline' print all connections in one line.  This
  bug appeared in 1.2.7rc3, a consequnce of Bug#1815.
- Bug 1868 - Wrong cmdopts in ftpcount.c.
- Added custom memory scrubber routine to deal with the issue mentioned in
  this Bugtraq thread: http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/298598

1.2.7rc3 - Released 15-Nov-2002
-------------------------------
- Fixed configure script detection and handling of ncurses (HAVE_LIBNCURSES
  was not being properly defined).
- Added --enable-scoreboard-buffer-size option to configure script, for
  tuning the size of some scoreboard fields (e.g. the full client command
  and the current working directory).
- Bug 1287 - Error compile with autoshadow option.  AIX does not have
  traditional shadow support, and uses other mechanisms.  This means that
  the --enable-autoshadow and --enable-shadow configure options should not
  be used when configuring proftpd for AIX.  The configure script has been
  updated to detect when these options are used on AIX, and to automatically
  disable them.
- Bug 1722 - Can't work magic cookie %F on FreeBSD.
- Make sure session.xfer uses cleared memory so unset structure members
  won't contain random values.
- Fixed handling of AuthAliasOnly, broken slightly by Bug#1567.
- Bug 1800 - Proftpd child segfaults when using a PASS without no USER first.
  mod_wrap was making a bad assumption about the USER name being available.
  This assumption has been corrected.
- Bug 1803 - Check for SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG to determine LFS support
  breaks some Linux installations
- Bug 1805 - PAM support under Mac OS X
- Bug 1772 - Docs fixup in RPM spec file
- Bug 1398 - there is no log rotate for /var/log/xferlog
- Bug 1814 - class names are truncated in scoreboard entry
- ftptop can now use either curses or ncurses
- Bug 1818 - proftpd doesn't compile on hpux11
- Bug 1760 - AllowOverwrite not operational.
- Bug 1703 - mod_sql_mysql compile error.  This was eventually tracked down
  to an overlap between ProFTPD's bundled getopt implementation, and
  MySQL's bundled getopt implementation.  To prevent this problem, a new
  --without-getopt configure option has been added, which tells the ProFTPD
  build process to explicitly not use the ProFTPD bundled getopt
  implementation.
- Only link ftptop with lib{n,}curses - it isn't needed in any other
  binaries
- Bug 1815 - Patch to add class information to ftpwho (with verbose on)
- Bug 1810 - Wrong permissions assigned to uploaded file.  This turned out
  to be related to the addition of the statcache code, and its interaction
  with the UserOwner and GroupOwner configuration directives.
- Bug 1830 - MaxClientsPerHost (small) Bug.  Off-by-one error in the handling
  of the MaxClientsPerHost directive, introduced by the change in timing of
  scoreboard modifications of the new scoreboarding code.
- ftpasswd now exits with different values, depending on the problem cause.
  Thanks to Graham Dunn <gdunn@inscriber.com> for these changes.

1.2.7rc2 - Released 22-Oct-2002
-------------------------------
- Bug 1757 - non-ANSI Syntax in netio.c
- Bug 1735 - Proftpd 1.2.6 compiled on FreeBSD 4.6.2 exits on signal 11
- Bug 1759 - ftpwho shows much more connections than really is.  This bug
             only occurred for those daemons running in inetd mode.
- Bug 1769 - Lack of supplemental groups can cause segfault.  This bug is
             a result of the fix for Bug 1666.
- Bug 1770 - Forgetting to check for no IP in string.
- Moved the switching to the User/Group for a vhost up in the order, to occur
  before any modules' session initialization callback is invoked.
- Bug 1644 - LogFormat local IP and FQDN tags missing.  Added %L to LogFormat
             meta sequences for logging local server IP address, and %V for
             logging local server FQDN.
- Bug 1785 - Bad handling of symlinks.  This bug appeared as a consequence
             of Bug#1486's fix, which involved caching of struct stats in
             order to effect a speed-up of directory listings.
- Bug 1778 - 1.2.7rc1 fails to link on OpenBSD 3.2-current.  The ftptop
             utility was not properly utilizing the macro detecting the
             presence (or absence) of the ncurses library.
- Adding new configure options (see configure --help) for setting some of
  the "tunable" values in options.h via the configure command.

- Bug 1674 - Changed timing of allocation of dynamic buffer (to avoid segfaults)
             in the supplied fgetgrent() function, which is used for
             AuthGroupFiles under FreeBSD.
- Bug 1697 - Fixed memory leak involving allocated regex_t *s and SIGHUP
- Bug 1701 - Fixed/enhanced name/IP matching function by adding matching of

1.2.6rc1 - Released 02-July-2002
--------------------------------

             PRE_CMD handler (RETR PRE_CMD handler did not have these checks)
- Added new Define, <IfDefine>, <IfModule> configuration directives, new
  command-line option -D (a la Apache)

- Bug 1643 - Cleaned up several source code files.
- Bug 1569 - Cygwin support, added README.cygwin
- Bug 1171 - Added handling backslash-escaped newlines in configuration files,
             so that a directive can be split across multiple lines using
             a trailing \ before the newline character.
- Removed the deprecated AllowChmod and ShowDotFiles configuration directives.
- Bug 1655 - Added support for a -n option when listing directories.
- Bug 1502 - Added a lingering_close function.  As discussed in the bug
             report, this may cause issues with some clients; keep an eye
             for this, as the timeout (ten minutes) may be too long or short.
- Bug 1664 - Changed mod_sql to decline UID-to-name resolution if a UID
             field has been configured to NULL; similarly for GID.
- Removed mod_quota.c due to bugs, lack of maintainership.  Consult
  http://bugs.proftpd.org for a list of the mod_quota bugs.
- Bug 1667 - Moved definition of USE_SHADOW, AUTO_SHADOW macros from command
             line into config.h, with the other macros.
- Bug 1628 - Added getgroups auth handler to mod_sql.  The lack of this was
             causing some DefaultRoot directives (those that relied on
             group-expressions) not be correctly honored, as mod_sql was
             not supplying the groups for the users.
- Bug 1543 - Change mod_sql to not remove embedded whitespace within a
             username, just to strip leading and trailing whitespace.

-------------------------------
New mod_ldap (2.8.6)

The `AllowChmod' directive has been deprecated, and will not work
consistantly.  Use <Limit SITE_CHMOD> instead.

- Bug 1112 - Compilation fix for IRIX 6.2.

-------------------------------
- Bug 1085 - Better logging of "User is not a UserAlias" and "Can't find
  user."

  avoids DoS issues.  Built-in glob support is now always compiled in to
  proftpd regardless of libc support on build platform.
- New directive "MasqueradeAddress", used to emit a "fake" (non-interface) IP
  in server ident, magic cookies and PASV commands.  Useful for firewalled or
  NAT'd networks that are not FTP aware.

  scan proftpd.conf looking for ScoreboardPath, if all else fails
- Bug 1042 - <Directory /> arbitrarily not matching.

1.2.1 - Released 01-Mar-2001
----------------------------
- A relatively major issue was discovered with session.groups which may cause
  any group-expressions inside of <Limit> (DenyGroup, etc) to malfunction.
  This is the primary reason for the 1.2.1 release.
- Default CFLAGS changed from "-g3 -O6" to "-O2" because it is reported
  that -O6 is highly experimental, and including debugging really isn't all
  the useful, as someone _really_ interested in debugging can edit Make.rules.
- Defining classes without an explicit "Classes On" now generates a log
  warning.
- New mod_sql and mod_ldap from their respective maintainers.

1.2.0-final - Released 26-Feb-2001
----------------------------------
- Numerous additional bug fixes from Bugzilla.  See http://bugs.proftpd.org
  for more info.
- New and updated README.* and INSTALL.
- initgroups() support has been removed, it will be re-added in 1.3 after we
  have proper modular support in authentication modules.
- mod_sql.c, mod_sql_mysql.c and mod_sql_postgres.c back in, with a new
  maintainer (replacements for mod_sqlpw and friends).
- instead of using kill(pid,SIGCONT) to determine if scoreboard pids are
  correct, proftpd now uses kill(pid,0) which should be a lot lighter on
  heavy-load systems.  Thanks to Rob Schulhof <rrs@digisle.net> for pointing
  out that kill(pid,0) is both valid AND useful. ;) Also removed some
  completely useless and redundant /proc stat code which did the same thing
  as kill(pid,0) on linux systems.
- logging to file (via SystemLog) is now done with a single write instead of
  two in order to be atomic.

1.2.0rc3 - Released: 05-Feb-2001
--------------------------------
- mod_sqlpw.c, mod_mysql.c and mod_pgsql.c have been REMOVED from the
  distribution.  They are currently unmaintained and have numerous bugs.
  If any kind soul <grin> is interested in maintaining them, they may be
  brought back into a future version of proftpd.
- sendfile now defaults to off, use --enable-sendfile at configure
  time to enable.  Additionally, sendfile is probably fixed.
- initgroups/getgroups new defaults to off, use --enable-initgroups at
  configure time to enable (mainly useful for large systems).  Be careful,
  though, as initgroups/getgroups breaks module handling and will not work
  in conjunction with other third-party modules (mod_sqlpw, etc).
- Passive FTP works properly now (was broken in RC2).
- Compilation problems fixed on some obscure platforms.
- PAM authentication finally works again on Solaris (due to an annoying bug in
  Solaris).

----------------------------------
- sendfile() handles errors and non-optimal conditions The Right Way(tm).
