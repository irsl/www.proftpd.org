<P> ProFTPD is currently working toward a 1.2.0 release and is
currently in a feature freeze.  Once 1.2.0 ships, development will
begin on 1.3.x.  ProFTPD has adopted an even number for
production-quality versions of ProFTPD and odd numbers for development
releases.  That is, 1.2.x will be a production release -- the next
production release of ProFTPD will be 1.4.x.  The next development
release will be 1.3.x.  Stay tuned to the development mailing list for
details on features/functionality planned for 1.3.x.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, you'll find instructions on accessing the ProFTPD CVS
repository <A HREF="/docs/cvs.html">here</A>.</P>
